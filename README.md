My HTML learning journey with hands-on practice

 What is HTML?
HTML ( HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages.
It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN.
    • HyperText: Allows linking between web pages.
    • Markup Language: Uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, etc.
